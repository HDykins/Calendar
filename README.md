# Calendar

Interactive Calendar for the month of November created using Javascript and CSS. The calendar can act like a planner in that it can store text inputs on clicking the day, so that you can plan events for each day. Clicking a planned event allows you to edit the stored text. 

This project shows that I can use JavaScript to create and manipulate DOM nodes without JQuery and use CSS to style it. It also shows that I understand the processes behind the creation of the DOM tree, how to use for loops to create elements and objects, how to use event listeners and how to select nodes and use their data to create functionality.
